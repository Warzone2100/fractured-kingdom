ENC1MSG1			_("Did you hear that? It sounded like something exploded on the other side of that hill.")
ENC1MSG2			_("Could it be the Royalists? If they start landing troops this close to the base we're in big trouble.")
ENC1MSG3			_("Maybe. But don't you think they'd try to be more quiet if they're trying to sneak around us?")
ENC1MSG4			_("Let's go check it out...")

/* Encounter 2 Transmission */
ENC2MSG1			_("We've got bogeys coming at us from the valley!")
ENC2MSG2			_("Second squad, move up and defend the roadblock.")
ENC2MSG3			_("Be on your A-game gentlemen, we could be dealing with a Royalist attack!")

/* Resistance Negotiation Transmission */
RESNEGOMSG1			_("Greetings, this is the leader of the Resistance speaking.")
RESNEGOMSG2			_("I believe there has been a severe misunderstanding, it is quite obvious that you are not a Royalist.")
RESNEGOMSG3			_("But we do not need to be enemies, and I think we can settle this with diplomacy.")
RESNEGOMSG4			_("In order to resolve this, I will offer a negotiation.")
RESNEGOMSG5			_("Simply move one of your trucks to the marked area and meet with one of ours.")
RESNEGOMSG6			_("Once the negotiations are done, we can end this fighting before this escalates any further.")

/* Resistance Allied */
RESALLYMSG1			_("Thank you for accepting our negotiations Commander, and I'm very glad we were able to reach a peaceful resolution. Things could have really gotten out of hand.")
RESALLYMSG2			_("I also apologize for that brief skirmish earlier. Everyone is on edge here because we're paranoid of any Royalists attack.")
RESALLYMSG3			_("...")
RESALLYMSG4			_("My name is James. As I said earlier, I'm the leader of the Resistance.")
RESALLYMSG5			_("Judging by your wrecked transport, you're probably new around here. So I'll give you the scoop.")
RESALLYMSG6			_("This whole area used to be united under one kingdom, led by the old King.")
RESALLYMSG7			_("But one day the King passed away, and most of the kingdom broke apart.")
RESALLYMSG8			_("The King's most loyal followers united under the rule of the King's daughter the Princess, who then anointed herself as the new Queen.")
RESALLYMSG9			_("Since then, the Queen and her Royalists have been trying to restore the kingdom under her rule.")
RESALLYMSG10		_("Well that's the story, or at least the short version.")
RESALLYMSG11		_("So far we've been safe down south here, and most of the fighting has been up north.")
RESALLYMSG12		_("But every day the Royalists get bolder, and I've got a feeling it's only a matter of time before the Queen's goons try to make a move on us.")
RESALLYMSG13		_("You should probably get a base set up, since it looks like you'll be here for a while. We've also got some technology to share.")
RESALLYMSG14		_("Maybe with our forces working together, we might be able to hold out against them.")

/* Resistance Aggro'd */
RESAGGRMSG1			_("W-well then..!")
RESAGGRMSG2			_("I extend an olive branch and offer a peaceful solution, yet you insist on tearing it to shreds, huh?")
RESAGGRMSG3			_("If you think we're just gonna sit around and take it, well, you're wrong.")

/* Resistance Evac */
RESEVACMSG1			_("Attention brave Resistance members, this is James speaking.")
RESEVACMSG2			_("Even though this new foe is not among the Queen's Royalists, they have nonetheless proven to be quite formidable.")
RESEVACMSG3			_("...")
RESEVACMSG4			_("I have reached an agreement with the Coalition to evacuate our personnel to their base. Thus ensuring our survival in the event that these aggressors prevail.")
RESEVACMSG5			_("There is only one caveat...")
RESEVACMSG6			_("I will be staying behind.")
RESEVACMSG7			_("This is the only way I could arrange their cooperation, I'm sure most of you already know why.")
RESEVACMSG8			_("Those of you who wish to remain and fight, thank you for your courage.")
RESEVACMSG9			_("I will remain here, with any brave volunteers, to fight off this attack. We must buy the transport more time to finish the evacuation.")
RESEVACMSG10		_("In the event that this base falls, those on the transport will survive.")

/* Royalist Introduction (From Resistance) */
RESROYMSG1			_("Those are Royalists!")
RESROYMSG2			_("How did they manage to get past the Hellraisers?")
RESROYMSG3			_("...")
RESROYMSG4			_("Commander, if the Royalists have troops here, they probably have a base too.")
RESROYMSG5			_("And they're gonna keep sending cyborgs until we take it out.")
RESROYMSG6			_("You lead the way, and we'll help you any way we can.")
RESROYMSG7			_("But be careful, the Royalists have access to very powerful weaponry and equipment.")
RESROYMSG8			_("And be extra cautious of the cyborgs with rocket launchers, they're devastating against vehicles!")

/* Royalist Message after destroying the south base (Resistance Allied) */
ROYAMSG1			_("Now would you look at that. James' little 'Resistance' have found themselves a new friend!")
ROYAMSG2			_("Well I've gotta to hand it to you kid, you've got some real guts messing with my things.")
ROYAMSG3			_("And it seems like you've really stirred up the hopes of those poor things you call your 'allies'. Without you I bet they couldn't even fend for themselves.")
ROYAMSG4			_("But don't think it'll amount to anything.")
ROYAMSG5			_("Do you even realize who I am?")
ROYAMSG6			_("I'm the Queen of the Royalists, and this is MY kingdom you've stepped on.")
ROYAMSG7			_("I control the most powerful military this kingdom has ever seen!")
ROYAMSG8			_("... Does that not matter to you in the slightest?")
ROYAMSG9			_("Well!")
ROYAMSG10			_("I have more pressing matters to attend to, but I look forward to stomping your merry band of neer-do-wells.")
ROYAMSG11			_("I'll be seeing you real soooon!")

/* Royalist Message after destroying the south base (Resistance Eradicated) */
ROYEMSG1			_("Well now would you look at that. Seems like there's someone new in town!")
ROYEMSG2			_("I've gotta to hand it to you kid, you've got some real guts messing with my things.")
ROYEMSG3			_("You must not be from around here, isn't that right?")
ROYEMSG4			_("And if the Resistance isn't with you...")
ROYEMSG5			_("...")
ROYEMSG6			_("You've got no idea who you are messing with, do you? Do you even realize who I am?")
ROYAMSG7			_("I'm the Queen of the Royalists, and this is MY kingdom you've stepped on.")
ROYEMSG8			_("I have more pressing matters to attend to for now, but I'll be seeing you around, buddy.")

/* AMPHOS Introduction (From Resistance) */
RESAMPMSG1			_("That base belongs to AMPHOS. They mostly operate in the East Lake, and they use hovercrafts to move between their islands.")
RESAMPMSG2			_("They've actually been around since before the fall of the old kingdom, operating as their own independent economic/military hybrid controlling traffic through the East Lake area.")
RESAMPMSG3			_("But after the King passed, AMPHOS became one of the two large factions that fought against the Royalists.")
RESAMPMSG4			_("AMPHOS saw the King's death as an opportunity to expand their influence grow their own territory.")
RESAMPMSG5			_("They were a real pain in the rear too, since their hovers were so fast they could fire barrages of rockets and then flee before taking any real damage.")
RESAMPMSG6			_("... Anyway, at some point the Royalists' own hovers started to catch up to AMPHOS, and eventually managed to get them to 'negotiate' an alliance.")
RESAMPMSG7			_("In what became known as the 'East Lake Deal', the Royalists had gained free access to the Eastern Lake and pacified one of their largest sources of pain.")
RESAMPMSG8			_("But with how much the Royalists grown in strength, I'm not sure AMPHOS acts much more than a puppet for them at this point.")
RESAMPMSG9			_("...")
RESAMPMSG10			_("The Royalists must have used that base to get past the Hellraisers.")
RESAMPMSG11			_("We'll need to clear it out to make sure the Royalists don't come back again.")

/* AMPHOS Pitch (From Resistance) */
RESAMPPITCHMSG1		_("Commander, we have been contacted by someone describing herself as an associate of the AMPHOS board of directors.")
RESAMPPITCHMSG2		_("She claims that she is sympathetic to our cause, and is willing to pull some strings among the higher-ups in AMPHOS in order to start negotiations.")
RESAMPPITCHMSG3		_("But she will need some help to convince the rest of the board.")
RESAMPPITCHMSG4		_("According to the associate, there has been a rising sense of fear among AMPHOS leadership since the East Lake Deal that the Royalists are preparing to turn against them once the opportunity arises.")
RESAMPPITCHMSG5		_("She thinks she can exploit this to get AMPHOS on our side.")
RESAMPPITCHMSG6		_("The Royalists have established a presence in the waters of the East Lake by building a base on the northwest island.")
RESAMPPITCHMSG7		_("They also have assigned a commander to patrol the northern waters of the East Lake.")
RESAMPPITCHMSG8		_("If you can eliminate that Royalist commander and clear out that base, and then give way to allow AMPHOS to build their own base on that island, she thinks she can arrange a negotiation.")
RESAMPPITCHMSG9		_("The trouble is, that Royalist base is quite far away, and there's a lot of AMPHOS defenses in the way.")
RESAMPPITCHMSG10	_("But according to the associate, as long as you stay clear of the AMPHOS main base, she should still be able to get the rest of the AMPHOS board to sign on to negotiations.")

/* AMPHOS Pitch (Resistance Eradicated) */
AMPPITCHMSG1		_("Greetings Commander, I am a member of the AMPHOS board of directors.")
AMPPITCHMSG2		_("I have observed your interactions with AMPHOS and Royalist forces so far, and I believe we are not truly enemies.")
AMPPITCHMSG3		_("While AMPHOS may have provided itself with a degree of temporary safety in its alliance with the Royalists, I, and others on this board, have found evidence that the Royalists may be preparing to turn on us whenever it most benefits them.")
AMPPITCHMSG4		_("This is where you come in.")
AMPPITCHMSG5		_("If you can remove the Royalist presence in the East Lake and allow our trucks to build on the large islands, I can convince the rest of the board that allying with you is more beneficial than remaining ignorant of the Royalists growing plans to backstab us.")
AMPPITCHMSG6		_("Just keep your distance from our main island base, and I'll keep working on softening up the board, OK?")

/* AMPHOS Negotiation Message */
AMPNEGOMSG1			_("Well, it appears that Alice was right about you.")
AMPNEGOMSG2			_("You've managed to push back against the Royalists and cleared us breathing room.")
AMPNEGOMSG3			_("And you've not only done so by yourself, without any assistance from us, but also while our forces were actively working against you.")
AMPNEGOMSG4			_("You really are something incredible. Do not think we will forget this extraordinary favor that you have done for us.")
AMPNEGOMSG5			_("Commander, as president of the AMPHOS board of directors, I hereby offer to negotiate an alliance with you at the designated location.")
AMPNEGOMSG6			_("Once the negotiations are through, we will share our technology and support your forces as you strike back against the Royalists!")
AMPNEGOMSG7			_("...")
AMPNEGOMSG8			_("Although, we WILL need to charge you to compensate for any and all damage you have previously caused AMPHOS.")
AMPNEGOMSG9			_("Hey-hey, no hard feelings, but it's a business!")

/* AMPHOS Negotiation Message (All other factions Eradicated) */
AMPNEGOALLEMSG1		_("Well, Commander.")
AMPNEGOALLEMSG2		_("You've managed to push back against the Royalists and cleared us breathing room.")
AMPNEGOALLEMSG3		_("And so, as president of the AMPHOS board of directors, you have my thanks.")
AMPNEGOALLEMSG4		_("...")
AMPNEGOALLEMSG5		_("But, we are aware of your actions across the kingdom.")
AMPNEGOALLEMSG6		_("The violence that you have caused, the lengths you have gone.")
AMPNEGOALLEMSG7		_("...")
AMPNEGOALLEMSG8		_("It is hard you would ally with us after all that you have done.")
AMPNEGOALLEMSG9		_("You have have helped us today, so we will repay your kindness.")
AMPNEGOALLEMSG10	_("I have sent a truck to negotiate an alliance with you at the designated location.")

/* AMPHOS Aggro'd Message */
AMPAGGRMSG1			_("You dare to challenge our might!?")
AMPAGGRMSG2			_("You have just made a grave mistake, Commander.")
AMPAGGRMSG3			_("We will blow your inferior hovercrafts out of the water, and then demolish out whatever meager structures you call your 'base'.")
AMPAGGRMSG4			_("In due time you will learn why AMPHOS is not to be trifled with!")

/* AMPHOS Betrayal Message */
AMPBTRYMSG1			_("...!")
AMPBTRYMSG2			_("After all you've done to seemingly aid us, you turn around and betray us at the very last moment?")
AMPBTRYMSG3			_("I don't think I'll ever be able to understand your judgment, Commander.")
AMPBTRYMSG4			_("But your betrayal will not go unpunished.")
AMPBTRYMSG5			_("We will blow your inferior hovercrafts out of the water, and then wipe out whatever meager structures you call a 'base'.")
AMPBTRYMSG6			_("In due time you'll be begging us for mercy!")

/* Royalist Message after allying with AMPHOS */
ROYAMPAMSG1			_("Wow.")
ROYAMPAMSG2			_("You're REALLY proving yourself to be quite a nuisance, aren't you?")
ROYAMPAMSG3			_("I honestly didn't think those snobby, self-absorbed half-wits at AMPHOS had it in them to turn against me at this point.")
ROYAMPAMSG4			_("But let me get one thing straight with you, Commander: this will change nothing.")
ROYAMPAMSG5			_("It doesn't matter how much you try to fight it, nothing will stop me from unifying my kingdom.")
ROYAMPAMSG6			_("AMPHOS' betrayal is only delaying the inevitable.")
ROYAMPAMSG7			_("I assure you, this won't end well. Neither for you or those backstabbing cowards at AMPHOS.")

/* Royalist Message after eradicating AMPHOS */
ROYAMPEMSG1			_("Bravo, Commander!")
ROYAMPEMSG2			_("You really showed those AMPHOS cowards who's boss.")
ROYAMPEMSG3			_("So credit where credit's due, you've saved me the trouble of having to wipe them out myself, so I thank you for taking it upon yourself to take out the trash.")
ROYAMPEMSG4			_("Now there's one less hassle I need to overcome before my kingdom has been reunified.")
ROYAMPEMSG5			_("What? Did you really think that alliance was going to last?")
ROYAMPEMSG6			_("AMPHOS was not loyal to me, they only had their own interests in mind.")
ROYAMPEMSG7			_("And there is only one cure for that.")
ROYAMPEMSG8			_("...")
ROYAMPEMSG9			_("Oh, don't worry Commander. Your turn is comming up soon.")

/* Hellraiser Introduction (From Resistance) */
RESHELMSG1			_("Careful, those structures in the hills belong to the Hellraisers.")
RESHELMSG2			_("The Hellraisers are super territorial. They've probably held out there since the fall of the old kingdom.")
RESHELMSG3			_("We've tried to reach out and negotiate with them in the past, but they're apparently pretty... unreceptive of outsiders.")
RESHELMSG4			_("Fortunately for us, they usually don't go far out of their own territory.")
RESHELMSG5			_("Unfortunately, they control the only land routes to get across the river to the north.")
RESHELMSG6			_("So at some point, we're going to have to deal with them.")
RESHELMSG7			_("Just be cautious when in their territory, that whole place is one big death trap.")
RESHELMSG8			_("Those cragged hills don't leave much room for maneuvering around. And the Hellraisers are fanatical about incendiary weapons.")
RESHELMSG9			_("Their patrols are armed with flamethrowers, and they've placed bunkers around every corner.")
RESHELMSG10			_("They've even modified their mortars to leave burning areas where they hit.")

/* Hellraiser Pitch */
HELPITCHMSG1		_("Attention interlopers!")
HELPITCHMSG2		_("This is the Warchief of the Hellraiser clan speaking.")
HELPITCHMSG3		_("You have trespassed into our clan's rightful territory.")
HELPITCHMSG4		_("While your skill in leading your forces in combat is remarkable, these games must now end.")
HELPITCHMSG5		_("If you dare continue forwards, we will show you no mercy.")
HELPITCHMSG6		_("We will burn your units to ash, and raze your structures to the ground until nothing remains.")
HELPITCHMSG7		_("...")
HELPITCHMSG8		_("However, if you turn back now, and allow us to repair the damage that you have caused, then we may be willing to negotiate a more peaceful resolution to this conflict.")
HELPITCHMSG9		_("The choice is yours, Commander.")

/* Hellraiser Negotiation Message */
HELNEGOMSG1			_("It seems you have some common sense after all.")
HELNEGOMSG2			_("You've ended your attacks against us, and allowed us to reclaim all of our territory.")
HELNEGOMSG3			_("And you have earned my personal respect, Commander.")
HELNEGOMSG4			_("I have sent a truck to begin negotiations for an alliance.")
HELNEGOMSG5			_("Once they are complete, we can then join our forces and incinerate any Royalist who dares to stand in our path!")

/* Hellraiser Aggro'd Message */
HELAGGRMSG1			_("Well, it seems you have made the wrong choice!")
HELAGGRMSG2			_("You are very brave, Commander. But also very foolish if you think you can best us.")
HELAGGRMSG3			_("These transgressions of yours shall not go unpunished!")
HELAGGRMSG4			_("We will purge your forces from our land like a wilfire tearing through a forest.")
HELAGGRMSG5			_("Perhaps once we've razed your vile base down to smoldering piles of ash, we will hear you beg for our mercy!")

/* Hellraiser Betrayal Message */
HELBTRYMSG1			_("Huh?")
HELBTRYMSG2			_("You encroach on our base, pull back and let us recover, only to attack us again?")
HELBTRYMSG3			_("Your tactics confuse me, Commander.")
HELBTRYMSG4			_("But if you think we'll play along with these back-and-forth shenanigans, then you are about to be VERY sorely mistaken!")
HELBTRYMSG5			_("Maybe once we've burnt your units to a crisp, we'll hear you beg for forgiveness!")

/* Coalition Pitch (Both Hellraisers and Resistance Allied) */
COAPITCHMSG1		_("So, you're the Commander I've heard so much about.")
COAPITCHMSG2		_("My name is Max, I'm the leader of the Coalition.")
COAPITCHMSG3		_("The Hellraisers tell me that you're a competent fighter and a respectable leader.")
COAPITCHMSG4		_("...But I can't say that I'm convinced yet, ")
COAPITCHMSG5		_("So I've got a mission for you.")
COAPITCHMSG6		_("The Royalists control a factory base wedged in the mountains north of you.")
COAPITCHMSG7		_("It serves as a critical manufacturing site for the Royalists, and allows them to produce units close to the frontline.")
COAPITCHMSG8		_("I want you to go there and destroy that base.")
COAPITCHMSG9		_("Do this for us, and I'll set up negotiations so we can really work together.")

/* Coalition Warning (Resistance Eradicated) */
COAWARN1MSG1		_("So, you're the Commander I've heard so much about.")
COAWARN1MSG2		_("You may have won over those Hellraisers with your antics, but you won't fool me.")
COAWARN1MSG3		_("I know what happened to the Resistance after they offered to ally with you. I know EXACTLY what you did.")
COAWARN1MSG4		_("Here's the only offer I'll give you:")
COAWARN1MSG5		_("You stay far, far away from any Coalition base, and stay out of our way, and I WON'T order my men tear you to shreds.")
COAWARN1MSG6		_("This deal is non-negotiable.")
COAWARN1MSG7		_("Capiche?")

/* Coalition Warning (Hellraisers Eradicated) */
COAWARN2MSG1		_("So, you're the Commander I've heard so much about.")
COAWARN2MSG2		_("You and your Resistance lackeys may have wiped out the Hellraisers.")
COAWARN2MSG3		_("But neither of you are any match against my Coalition.")
COAWARN2MSG4		_("So unless you want me to turn all of your tanks and cyborgs into scrap, you'll both stay far away from Coalition territory.")
COAWARN2MSG5		_("Capiche?")
COAWARN2MSG6		_("Oh, and tell the leader of the 'Resistance' that I know EXACTLY who he is.")

/* Coalition Introduction after either their pitch or warning (From Resistance) */
RESCOAMSG1			_("That message was from leader of the Coalition, Max.")
RESCOAMSG2			_("There is no faction that the Royalists, or the Queen herself, hates more than the Coalition.")
RESCOAMSG3			_("The Coalition was the first major group that formed once the old kingdom fell, with the sole purpose of putting a permanent end to the King's bloodline.")
RESCOAMSG4			_("Max is... well he's quite the lively character as they say. Haha...")
RESCOAMSG5			_("...")
/* This gets added to the message when following the Coalition's Pitch */
RESCOAPITCHMSG1		_("So, Max wants us to destroy that base for him, huh?")
RESCOAPITCHMSG2		_("That's not gonna be easy, the Royalists have that place well fortified.")
RESCOAPITCHMSG3		_("It seems kinda scummy to make us destroy that base for him, instead of working together to take it down.")
RESCOAPITCHMSG4		_("But hey, at least we've got your back, and we've got the Hellraisers working with us too.")
RESCOAPITCHMSG4ALT	_("But hey, at least we've got your back, and we've got the Hellraisers and AMPHOS working with us too.")
RESCOAPITCHMSG5		_("The Coalition would be one heck of an ally to have on our side against the Royalists.")
RESCOAPITCHMSG6		_("But it's your call how you wanna do this.")
/* This gets added to the message when following the Coalition's Warning */
RESCOAWARNMSG1		_("... And he r-really likes to trash talk, huh?")
RESCOAWARNMSG2		_("Commander, I think we should think about our next moves v-very carefully.")
RESCOAWARNMSG3		_("The Coalition might not have the tech the Royalists have, but they've been hardened by months of non-stop fighting, and they do NOT mess around.")
RESCOAWARNMSG4		_("If you think we can take on the Coalition, I trust your judgment.")
RESCOAWARNMSG5		_("If not, then well, it looks like we better heed his advice...")
RESCOAWARNMSG6		_("Just be careful, Okay?")

/* Coalition Negotiation Message  */
COANEGOMSG1			_("Well done, Commander!")
COANEGOMSG2			_("You've shown your prowess in combat, and therefore earned your place to fight alongside the Coalition's forces.")

COAAGGRWMSG4		_("Hah! I don't think so.")
